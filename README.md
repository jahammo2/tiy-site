This was our first assignment for the front end engineering course:


Implement this layout: http://academy.smashingboxes.com/

Don't worry about the animations, hover effects, forms, etc.

First, grab resources (images)
Implement the big, block layout
Implement your basic defaults: colors, fonts, h1, p, a styles, etc
Implement the page header details
Implement the page "hero" block details
etc.


This was a fairly difficult assignment to complete on our first day but I feel as if I did a decent
job considering it was our first day.
